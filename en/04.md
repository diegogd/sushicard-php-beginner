1. Variables are a way of storing a value for later use.

2. Lets tune the line in which we got credit about our work.

  ```php
    $author = "a cool ninja";
    echo "Done by " . $author;
  ```

  > PHP will always use a *$* sign at the start of its variables.

3. Feel free to change the text as you like. What do you expect to happen?

4. Variables can be of different types, you are not limited to just text, you can also use numbers (referred to as strings and integers).

  There are many differnet *types* a variable can be, some examples:

  * *string* - "Ma"
  * *integer* - 1
  * *boolean* - true / false

 You wont be using these in this tutorial, but are just here for context.

  * *arrays* - array(1,2,3,4,5)
  * *double* - 1.00000002

5. There isn't anything different you need to do when outputting different types. Lets change the instruction to be able to change the lower and higher number to use in the game through variables.

  ```php
    $lower_number = 1;
    $higher_number = 10;
    echo "Pick a number between {$lower_number} and {$higher_number}.";
  ```
You can see here a different way of displaying *variable* values in *strings*. There are multiple ways to join strings together in PHP the preferred method is to use `"{$variable}"`.
