1. Here is all the code of our game.

  ```html
    <html>
      <body>
        <?php
        echo "<h1>Guess number game!</h1>";
        $l_number = 1;
        $h_number = 10;

        // set game variables
        $s_number = $_POST['secret_number'];
        if(!$s_number) {
          $s_number = rand($l_number, $h_number);
        }
        $guess = $_POST['guess'];
        $tries = $_POST['tries'];
        if(!is_null($tries)) {
         $tries = $tries - 1;
        } else {
         $tries = 3;
        }
        echo "You have {$tries} tries left.";
        if ($guess) {
          echo "<p>Your guess is {$guess}. ";
          if($guess == $s_number) {           
            echo "You've found the number!";
          } elseif($guess > $h_number) {
            echo "Pick a lower number";
          } else {
            echo "You missed, try again!";
          }
          echo "</p>";
      ```

2. ```php
        } else {
          echo "Pick a number between {$l_number} and {$h_number}.";
        }
    ?>
      <form method="post">
          <input type="hidden" name="secret_number" value="<?php echo $s_number; ?>" />
          <input type="hidden" name="tries" value="<?php echo $tries; ?>" />
          <input name='guess'/>
      </form>
    </body>
    </html>

  ```

2. Things you've learnt from the previous cards.

  * *Text Output* - Talking to our users
  * *Variables* - Remembering values for use later.
  * *String concatenation* - Adding two different pieces of text together
  * *GET / POST* - How to read information passed through the server
  * *Conditional expression* - Checking conditions and performing actions if they are true

3. There are some things are are not working well yet. For example you should do something when you run out of tries.
