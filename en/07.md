1. We can get more from our game if we make it to make decisions, here they come the *Conditionals*.

 Conditionals are made up of an *expression* and *statement* blocks. Expressions are evaluated and if they equal `TRUE` then the code in the statement block is run.

  ```php
  <?php
      if($guess == $my_random_number) {           
          echo "Great, you find out the number!";
      }
  ?>
  ```

2. Sometimes you need to also check for the oppersite of your expression. For this we can use the `else` keyword. This means if the first expression is false, the statement in the else block is run instead.

  ```php
  <?php
    if($guess == $my_random_number) {           
      echo "Great, you've found the number!";
    } else {
      echo "You missed, try again!";
    }
  ?>
  ```

3. Finally, sometimes you want to check more cases than just this or that. For this you can use the `elseif` keyword, which allows you to run another expression to see if that block evaluates true, leading to the statement block running.

  ```php
  <?php
    if($guess == $my_random_number) {           
      echo "Great, you've found the number!";
    } elseif($guess > $higher_number) {
      echo "You missed, pick a lower number";
    } else {
      echo "You missed, try again!";
    }
  ?>
  ```

  > You can chain as many elseifs together as you want.
