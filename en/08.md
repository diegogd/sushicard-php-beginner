1. Game gives only an opportunity to find the number. That is mainly because we are generating the number that we have to find out every time the web is reloaded. But we can pass this secret number every time we reload, so we can have multiple tries. Modify your form to look like this:

  ```php
    <form method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="secret_number" value="<?php echo $my_random_number; ?>" />
        <input name='guess'/>
    </form>
  ```

  Notice that we have added a new input field that is *hidden*. And we have changed the method in which the form is sent, sending by *POST* you will not see the parameters in the url.

2. Then we have to change the way we generate the random number and the way we get the picked number from the user.

 ```php
    $my_random_number = $_POST['secret_number'];
    if(!$my_random_number) {
      $my_random_number = rand($lower_number, $higher_number);
    }
    $guess = $_POST['guess'];
 ```

 The `if` sentence checks if the variable has been passed through the form, if not a new number is generated.

3. If you want to limit the tries to a certain number you can create another variable and use some maths to decrease the number of available tries.

  ```php
   $tries = $_POST['tries'];
   if(!is_null($tries)) {
     $tries = $tries - 1;
   } else {
     $tries = 3;
   }
   echo "You have {$tries} tries left.";
  ```

4. Remember that you have also to add the field in the form.

  ```php
  <input type="hidden" name="tries" value="<?php echo $tries; ?>" />
  ```
